In software engineering, quality metrics are standards of measurement used to determine the quality of a software product. These metrics help in assessing the performance, functionality, and overall quality of the software, providing insights that can guide improvements and ensure that the software meets specified requirements and standards.

Q......]]]]]]]]]] Key Quality Metrics in Software Engineering

1. Code Quality Metrics
   - Cyclomatic Complexity: Measures the complexity of the code by counting the number of linearly independent paths through the code.
   - Code Coverage: Indicates the percentage of the codebase that is covered by automated tests.
   - Code Churn: Tracks the amount of code that is added, modified, or deleted over a period of time.

2. Performance Metrics
   - Response Time: The time it takes for the system to respond to a user action or request.
   - Throughput: The number of transactions or operations a system can handle in a given period.
   - Resource Utilization: Measures how efficiently the system uses resources such as CPU, memory, and disk I/O.

3. Reliability Metrics
   - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): The average time between system failures.
   - Mean Time to Repair (MTTR): The average time it takes to repair a system after a failure.
   - Failure Rate: The frequency of system failures over a specified period.

4. Usability Metrics
   - User Satisfaction: Measured through surveys and feedback from users.
   - Task Completion Rate: The percentage of tasks that users can complete successfully.
   - Error Rate: The frequency of errors made by users during interactions with the system.

5. Security Metrics
   - Vulnerability Density: The number of vulnerabilities found in the codebase relative to its size.
   - Time to Patch: The time it takes to release a fix for a reported vulnerability.
   - Number of Security Incidents: The number of security breaches or incidents reported.

6. Maintainability Metrics
   - Code Maintainability Index: A measure of how easy it is to maintain the codebase.
   - Defect Density: The number of defects found in the software relative to its size.
   - Technical Debt: The implied cost of future rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer.

7. Process Metrics
   - Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE): The percentage of defects found and removed before the software is released.
   - Lead Time: The total time from the creation of a feature or task until its delivery.
   - Sprint Velocity: The amount of work a team can complete in a single sprint, measured in story points or hours.

These metrics provide a comprehensive view of software quality and help in identifying areas for improvement, ensuring the development of reliable, efficient, and user-friendly software products.

Q......]]]]]]]]]] Software Maintenance

Software maintenance is the process of modifying and updating software applications after delivery to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or adapt the software to a changed environment. It is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle, ensuring the software continues to function as expected and remains useful and relevant over time.

Q......]]]]]]]]]] Types of Software Maintenance

1. Corrective Maintenance
   - Purpose: Fix defects and bugs identified in the software.
   - Examples: Addressing issues such as software crashes, incorrect outputs, or security vulnerabilities.

2. Adaptive Maintenance
   - Purpose: Adapt the software to changes in the environment.
   - Examples: Updating the software to work with new operating systems, hardware, or external services and APIs.

3. Perfective Maintenance
   - Purpose: Improve or enhance the software's functionality and performance.
   - Examples: Adding new features, optimizing code for better performance, or refining the user interface based on feedback.

4. Preventive Maintenance
   - Purpose: Prevent potential issues and improve the software's maintainability.
